AI Stadium Energy Simulation

A real-time interactive simulation that explores how **crowd noise** and **footsteps** in stadiums can be converted into **electrical energy** using a hybrid model of physics and artificial intelligence.

This project blends **sound signal processing**, **motion energy estimation**, and **visual simulation** to raise awareness of sustainable energy opportunities in high-footfall environments like sports venues.

Objective

To simulate a futuristic stadium where:
- Every **cheer** from the crowd and
- Every **step** taken by attendees  
â€¦ generates and contributes to a **live energy meter**.

Technologies Used

- **Python + Librosa + NumPy** for analyzing `.wav` files and calculating sound-based energy.
- **AI model** (CNN or regression) for estimating power based on sound patterns and movement.
- **Matplotlib / Streamlit** for interactive visualization and dashboards (optional).

Scientific Foundations

 Sound to Energy
1. Compute **RMS** and **SPL (dB)** from audio signals.
2. Convert SPL to **pressure** (Pa).
3. Use physics formula to estimate:
